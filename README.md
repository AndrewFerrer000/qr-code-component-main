## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- rem and em units

### What I learned

What I learned on this challenge is how can I use the rem and em units to set the `font-size` `padding` `margin` and even the `width` of the div. I also follow the semantic format for the better structure in my document such `main` and `footer`.

### Continued development

I've been coding for a years and I stopped for 4 months, I discovered this website to help me recap my knowledge and skills so I will continue to finish the challenges from Newbie to Advanced until I get a job.
